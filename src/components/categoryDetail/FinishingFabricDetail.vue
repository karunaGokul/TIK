        Fabric finishing as a process may or may not be an individual unit in
        the textile industry, it can be part of a knitting unit or a large
        manufacturing set up which contains almost all processes leading to the
        end product. Any company which only involves itself in fabric finishing
        as a process might find it a huge challenge to find the right clients to
        give them steady business. The relationship that you build on TIK App
        with your vendors and buyers is very strong and will be a lasting one as
        it is built on trust, transparency and quality of service.
