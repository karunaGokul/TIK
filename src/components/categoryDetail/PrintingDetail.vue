        The textile printing industry is more or less like a cottage industry.
        Every little home in small towns will set up small units where they take
        up block printing, roller or screen printing jobs. TIK App will create a
        revolution here by enabling even such small job workers to gain orders
        from bigger companies and assist them in gaining and operating their
        businesses smoothly.
