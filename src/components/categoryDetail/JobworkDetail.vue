        There are innumerable small scale job work units in the textile industry
        which support the mainstream manufacturers. Connecting these job workers
        to the bigger companies is not an easy task. This is where middlemen or
        brokers gain advantage and charge huge commissions and take away a major
        portion of the income which is due to these job workers. TIK App makes
        the business connect for these job workers with manufacturing facilities
        really easy. It eliminates the middlemen and brings transparency in the
        business dealings.
